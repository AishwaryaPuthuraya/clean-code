# 25 Colour Code Manual

Code is efficiently written but the purpose of the code is not clear. Adding comments to help developer understand what exactly the code is meant to do would have helped.
The function name of the code says printColorMap() but it is always printing the same minor colour for every major color 5 times. The purpose of code is unclear.
